# Statistics

A sample took from the population is analysed and used to generalise to the population.

### Sampling methods

##### Simple random sampling
Choosing random people from a list.

##### Convenience sampling
Choosing people most convenient to ask.

##### Systematic sampling
Asking every nth people you encounter.

#### Grouping methods
Every group has a representation proportional to its size.

##### Quota sampling
Firstly population divided into groups, then convenience sampling.

##### Stratified sampling
Firstly population divided into groups, then simple random sampling.

### Example
30 Batory High School Students

- S.R.S — 30 random students out of 800
- C.S. — public form (e.g. on Teams channel), asking in the corridor
- Sys. Samp. — near entrance, asking every nth person
- Q.S. — divide students by e.g. years
- Str. Samp. — divide in groups, choose students randomly
